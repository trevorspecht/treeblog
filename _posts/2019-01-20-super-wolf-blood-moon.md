title:  "Super Wolf Blood Moon!"

## My first blog post

I have a different reason for starting a weblog, but since it's kinda coming together on this rare event of a super wolf blood moon eclipse, I figured I'd just go ahead and make my first post in honor of this astronomical and astrological event.

As I edit this markdown file in my text editor of choice (Atom), the moon is almost gone. Soon (around 12:12 ET I hear) it will get real bloody. That's what I'm waiting for! I don't have a good camera or telescope available, but I'll see if I can get some kind of photos from Wilmington, Delaware, my current location. Stay tuned!
